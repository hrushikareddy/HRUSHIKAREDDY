    <p>While it is important to have naturally occurring sugars in your diet, 
        many foods contain harmful added sugars that contain no nutritional value.  According to a study conducted by the University of Florida, 
        the brain releases heroin-like chemicals called endogenous opioids when an individual indulges on sweet, 
        salty or fatty foods. </p>
